## Why Rust is the Future of Systems Programming

Are you tired of programming languages that compromise safety for speed or vice versa? Are you looking for a language that can help you build fast and secure systems with ease? Look no further than Rust!

Rust is a systems programming language that was developed with safety and performance in mind. It has quickly become a popular choice for building low-level software like operating systems, device drivers, and network servers. Here are just a few reasons why Rust is the future of systems programming:

### Memory Safety

Memory safety is one of the biggest challenges in systems programming. In languages like C and C++, developers have to manually manage memory, which can lead to bugs like buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and memory leaks. These bugs can cause serious security vulnerabilities, crashes, and other issues.

Rust addresses this problem by using a unique ownership model that ensures memory safety at compile time. With Rust, you don't have to worry about manual memory management, and you can be confident that your code is free from these types of bugs.

### Performance

Rust was designed to be fast. It's a compiled language that can produce highly optimized machine code, which makes it ideal for low-level programming tasks. Rust also has a lightweight runtime, which means that it can be used in resource-constrained environments.

In addition, Rust's performance is not limited to just raw speed. Its ownership model also allows for efficient memory allocation and deallocation, which can lead to better cache locality and reduced memory fragmentation.

### Expressiveness

Despite its focus on safety and performance, Rust is also an expressive language that's easy to use. Its syntax is similar to C and C++, so developers with experience in those languages can quickly pick up Rust.

Rust also has a strong type system that can catch errors at compile time. This can save developers a lot of time and headaches, as it can catch many types of bugs before they make it into production.

### Growing Community

Rust is backed by a vibrant and growing community of developers who are passionate about the language. This community has developed a rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that can help you get started with Rust quickly and easily.

From web development to game programming to machine learning, Rust has something for everyone. And with its growing popularity, the Rust community is only going to get stronger in the coming years.

### Conclusion

Rust is a powerful and versatile language that's perfect for building fast and secure systems. Its unique ownership model ensures memory safety, while its performance and expressiveness make it a joy to use. With a growing community and a bright future ahead, Rust is definitely a language worth learning.

So why wait? Start exploring Rust today and discover why it's the future of systems programming!

### Code example

```rust
use arguments::{Args, Verb};
use clap::Parser;

pub(crate) mod arguments;
pub mod error;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    env_logger::builder().init();

    let args = Args::parse();

    match args.verb {
        Verb::Build => build(args).await,
        _ => todo!(),
    }
}
```
